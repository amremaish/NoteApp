# Notes App Backend

## Summary

This project demonstrates the development of a backend system using Spring Boot for a notes app supporting multiple users. The application's core features include user authentication, folder creation (both public and private), adding text notes and image uploads to folders, and ensuring users can access their private and public folders. Additionally, it implements JWT-based authentication and utilizes Postgres as the database.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Spring Boot 2.4
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication & stateless session
- **Database**: Postgres 12
- **Languages**: Java 8
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Tomcat Server**
- **Swagger â€” UI for API documentation**

How to Run the Project
-----------------

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash

    cd NoteApp
    ```

2. **Set Up the Database:**
    - Install Postgres if you haven't already.
    - Create a new database named `notes`.
    - Update the `application.properties` file with your database credentials.

3. **Build and Run the Application:**
    - Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
    - Build and run the application.
    - Alternatively, you can use Maven to build and run the application:

      ```bash
      mvn spring-boot:run
      ```

4. **Test the Endpoints:**
